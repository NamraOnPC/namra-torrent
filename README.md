## Personalized Bittorrent

Currently this can only download single files, not files in folders.

What's to come next:

* A graphic user interface
* Support for downloading big folders
* Ability to reconnect to dropped connections 
* Support for pausing and resuming downloads
* Support for uploading (currently the client only downloads)
